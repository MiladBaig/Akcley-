# Ackley function plot and optimization by genetic algorithm (Python)


## Description:

The Ackley function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms. In its two-dimensional form, it is characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at the centre. The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing algorithms, to be trapped in one of its many local minima.

## Input domain:

The function is usually evaluated on the hypercube xi ∈ [-32.768, 32.768], for all i = 1, …, d, although it may also be restricted to a smaller domain. 

## Global Minimum:

f(x*) = 0, at x* = (0,...,0)
